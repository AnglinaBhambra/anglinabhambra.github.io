This time last year, I was a couple of months into my Machine Learning internship. I spoke about my experience prior to my internship in my [previous post](https://anglinabhambra.github.io/how-i-became-a-machine-learning-engineer/). This post discusses my first week and some of the challenges that I faced during the rest of my internship.
