In my previous posts, I spoke about:  
‚áí [Part 0](https://anglinabhambra.github.io/how-i-became-a-machine-learning-engineer/) - My experience prior to my internship.  
‚áí [Part 1](https://anglinabhambra.github.io/my-machine-learning-internship-experience-part-1/) - My first week and some of the challenges thereafter.  

## TL;DR
- You don't need to be an expert on any one topic, especially when juggling multiple projects. Get good systems in place to fill in your knowledge gaps.
- Here is a short summary of my most notable tips for getting a good system in place:  
  ‚Üí Make time to learn each day (Check out "Valuable Resources" below).  
  ‚Üí Solidify an approach to obtaining a basic understanding of any topic.  
  ‚Üí Approach projects with architecture diagrams that you can iterate on.

## Projects üìù
I was mainly involved in the first phases of two projects. One was a Horizon 2020 (H2020) project, and the other was an Innovate UK project. H2020 is the biggest EU Research and Innovation programme ever. Innovate UK is part of UK Research and Innovation, a non-departmental public body funded by a grant-in-aid from the UK government.

### H2020‚Ää-‚ÄäHumMingBird
The aim of [HumMingBird](https://hummingbird-h2020.eu/) (it's still ongoing) is to better understand changing migration flows. My company's contribution was split into 4 sub-products, where my team's sub-product was a drought mapping system for the Horn of Africa. The work and research I did, contributed to producing the first iteration of this sub-product.

The first thing I had to do was to efficiently understand how to use satellite data to map drought in specific regions. This was a daunting task because I had very minimal experience **reading academic papers**. Embarrassing to admit, I faced my fears and asked for help. My manager walked me through the basics, then shared this [awesome article](https://towardsdatascience.com/how-you-should-read-research-papers-according-to-andrew-ng-stanford-deep-learning-lectures-98ecbd3ccfb3) on "How You Should Read Research Papers".

My colleague started building out the pipelines to implement some of the ideas that we had come up with, so I attempted **testing the pipelines using PyTests**. I definitely should have tried Unit Testing first, but I had come across a great tutorial on Twitch (mentioned below in "Valuable Resources") that explained how to use PyTests in an easy-to-understand way.
