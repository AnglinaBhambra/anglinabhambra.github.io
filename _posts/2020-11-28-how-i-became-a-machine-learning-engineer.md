This post outlines how I changed careers and my journey to *getting my foot in the door*. I studied Mechanical Engineering at university, then started a career in sales. Technical sales to be specific, where I was selling all kinds of tech courses, conferences and free meet-ups.

I wanted to learn more about data and sustainability. During my time in sales, I self-taught myself python and had taken a 2-day course on Deep Learning. I was speaking to someone new every other week about advice for career changing, or a potential interview, but alas it didn’t lead me very far. After a year and a half of working in sales I’d had enough. **I quit.**

After quitting, I did some solo-travelling, started a few miscellaneous courses (data science and Tableau to name a few) and worked for a short time in sales again. It felt like the gap year I had always wanted to take (in a 6-month period).

I was eager to get my foot in the door, but at the same time I came to a realisation. I need to work on projects. If there is one piece of advice you take away from reading this article, it is that **your experience and the projects you work on can provide you with a great grounding point to take off from.**

This was the first year I participated in [Hacktoberfest](https://hacktoberfest.digitalocean.com/), but there were only 2 events left to join when I signed up. One where I learnt a whole lot about Git, and another where I met 2 awesome guys who showed me how to start my own project, like a to-do list app. I had also kept in touch with a contact (we’ll call him Karl) that I had reached out to during my time in Sales, and Karl would periodically tell me about events and introduce me to his contacts.

My project work prior to this point was very limited. I had a large tech network on LinkedIn due to my time working in technical sales, so I made a post about getting started with project advice.

In the space of 1 week thereafter, here is what happened:
