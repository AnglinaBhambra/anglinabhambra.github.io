I wanted to learn more about data and sustainability. During my time in sales, I self-taught myself python and had taken a 2-day course on Deep Learning. I was speaking to someone new every other week about advice for career changing, or a potential interview, but alas it didn’t lead me very far. After a year and a half of working in sales I’d had enough. **I quit.**
