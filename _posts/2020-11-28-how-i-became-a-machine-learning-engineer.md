This post outlines how I changed careers and my journey to *getting my foot in the door*. I studied Mechanical Engineering at university, then started a career in sales. Technical sales to be specific, where I was selling all kinds of tech courses, conferences and free meet-ups.

I wanted to learn more about data and sustainability. During my time in sales, I self-taught myself python and had taken a 2-day course on Deep Learning. I was speaking to someone new every other week about advice for career changing, or a potential interview, but alas it didn’t lead me very far. After a year and a half of working in sales I’d had enough. **I quit.**

After quitting, I did some solo-travelling, started a few miscellaneous courses (data science and Tableau to name a few) and worked for a short time in sales again. It felt like the gap year I had always wanted to take (in a 6-month period).
